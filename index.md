### Research Interests

My research is in Human-Computer Interaction & Design, with a particular focus on the following areas:

- [Human-Engaged Computing](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42486-019-00007-0/) (HEC)
- The Construction of Interaction Rhythm Theory
- Data, Computational, and Adaptive Interactions 
- Emipical Studies in the Mental Health within Daily Activities
- Design of Inteactive Technologies (e.g., AR/VR)

The current project is **Approaching Rhythm towards Synergized Interactions**.
