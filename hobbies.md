  <p>
    I am an avid hiker and trekker. During the COVID-19, I embarked on a backpacking journey in western China (滇藏线，川藏线，新藏线...) for over a year, exploring the region through hiking and hitchhiking. Along the way, I engaged in conversations with various individuals, witnessed awe-inspiring landscapes in remote areas(<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/043b1nt5rkxwWDisE_zg8w">狮泉河至叶城</a>), and developed admiration for the countless pilgrims on the road...

    I have written some travel experiences in the form of short articles (<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/bs45aBxZkw4K1uY3S5z5sQ">冈仁波齐</a>, <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/fL2IaIrJf-3L_Fy4nJnz8A">洛克线</a>, <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/zDHZY76mN7i6p1i0e42uww">武功山</a>, <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Df5suS7bnD8Gxb9KYJjNtw">雨崩</a>...), which I have uploaded to my personal WeChat official account (闲檀). If you are interested, you can subscribe to it. Certainly, you can also reach out to me through WeChat (tan_peng_hci) to discuss our travel experiences and perhaps even plan our next hiking trip together.

    Currently, I am in <strong>Japan</strong>, utilizing my vacation time to hike two pilgrimage routes: (1) <strong><a href="https://www.tb-kumano.jp/en/kumano-kodo/">Kumano Kodo</a></strong> and (2) <strong><a href="https://shikoku-tourism.com/en/shikoku-henro/shikoku-henro">Shikoku Island's 88 Temples</a></strong>.

    <strong>Hiking has become a lifelong lifestyle for me</strong>. The following image depicts the trajectory of my travels in China.

  <p>
    I'm very happy to have successfully enjoyed the <strong>Kobe Marathon 2023</strong>. During the run, I felt the enthusiasm of the city's residents, the support of fellow runners, the beautiful scenery, and the human care. I will continue to run forward~

    Next, I will prepare for <strong>Takushima Marathon 2024</strong>~
