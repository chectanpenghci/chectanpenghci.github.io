### Hiker

I am an avid hiker and trekker. During the COVID-19, I embarked on a backpacking journey in western China (**滇藏线**，**川藏线**，**新藏线**) for over a year, exploring the region through hiking and hitchhiking. Along the way, I engaged in conversations with various individuals, witnessed awe-inspiring landscapes in remote areas, and developed admiration for the countless pilgrims on the road... 

I have written some travel experiences in the form of short articles, which I have uploaded to my personal WeChat official account (**闲檀**). If you are interested, you can subscribe to it. Certainly, you can also reach out to me through WeChat (tan_peng_hci) to discuss our travel experiences and perhaps even plan our next hiking trip together.

**Hiking has become a lifelong lifestyle for me.**
