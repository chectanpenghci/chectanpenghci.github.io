### Outdoors

- Hiking, Treking, City Walk.

I am an avid hiker and trekker. During the COVID-19, I embarked on a backpacking journey in western China (**滇藏线**，**川藏线**，**新藏线**) for over a year, exploring the region through hiking and hitchhiking. Along the way, I engaged in conversations with various individuals, witnessed awe-inspiring landscapes in remote areas([狮泉河至叶城](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/043b1nt5rkxwWDisE_zg8w)), and developed admiration for the countless pilgrims on the road... 

I have written some travel experiences in the form of short articles ([冈仁波齐](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/bs45aBxZkw4K1uY3S5z5sQ),[洛克线](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/fL2IaIrJf-3L_Fy4nJnz8A),[武功山](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/zDHZY76mN7i6p1i0e42uww),[雨崩](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Df5suS7bnD8Gxb9KYJjNtw)...), which I have uploaded to my personal WeChat official account (**闲檀**). If you are interested, you can subscribe to it. Certainly, you can also reach out to me through WeChat (tan_peng_hci) to discuss our travel experiences and perhaps even plan our next hiking trip together.

**Hiking has become a lifelong lifestyle for me.** The following image depicts the trajectory of my travels in China.
