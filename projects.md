### Previous Project: Human-Engaged Computing for Digital Heritage Education. (2016-2020)

<details>
  <summary><strong>Investigating Digital Heritage Education (DHE) in Classroom</strong></summary>
  <p>
   In the DHE classroom, students use digital tools to assist in understanding intangible cultural heritage (ICH), which comprises intricate knowledge. However, studentsmay still encounter obstacles when trying to produce creative designs. To address this issue, we propose a framework that adopts a <mark>human-engaged computing</mark> perspective to enhance the understanding and design of ICHthrough phased synergized engagement between engaged students and engaging digital tools. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we designed, implemented, and tracked Cantonese Porcelain (CP) Creative Design courses over five years.<br><img src="/images/dhe.jpg"><br>

  <summary><strong>Designing Interactive Technologies for Novice Engagement of DHE</strong></summary>
  <p>
    The purpose of this project is to explore interactive technologies for learning Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) through embodied interaction, with a focus on learning and experience with traditional <mark>Cantonese Porcelain</mark> crafting. In addition to exploring the effects of various interactive technologies on learning ICH, we also place particular emphasis on the positive implications of integrating mobile augmented reality technology with physical ICH materials as a novel perspective for enhancing novice engagement and understanding of ICH.<br><img src="/images/webar.jpg"><br>
